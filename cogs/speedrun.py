'if i didnt get the key, that would have been sub 4' 'i got the first door, it was so close' like please and thank you ffs, lets not talk about passing 1/10 runs because pq is usually slow, just how many runs die to ramparts, the terrible level layout of stilt and trying to find sepulcher before you have to reset because it took you too long to do it, and sep which ive talked about, there are so many times sub 4 was literally there for me but i didnt get it. that is the most frustrating part - just how many runs ive thrown away to the very end of sepulcher, thats literally why i keep trying (because i know i can do it) but i have 0 patience anymore, i just want this to be over soon","This game's a fucking joke. I boot up trying to get a good old 5BC NMG speedrun going and pick out my build, with Barbed Tips for some optimal cheese. Doing the run and guess what? 53 arrows with a Hokuto's buff is doing jack shit to the boss. I'm still on WR pace though so I keep going until Astro, where 3 librarians gang up and destroy the few little bits of sanity I have trying to survive that dogshit biome with a mob composition hand-crafted to make speedrunners suffer the most scientifically possible.
